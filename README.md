#  A Simple Introduction

##What I loved
- During my spare time, I learn Java and Android programing through Google official course. And I am a member of TwTstudio's mobile developing team. According to the plan of our team, I will develop a module of Weipeiyang.I spend my spare time to discover some interesting software and great repositories on GitHub. Of course, I also have a GitHub account. I love GitHub very much because it always gives me inspiration.
- SoftWare,it is open, living, and fascinating .Many people think it is really hard and tried to develop software. But I feel I just do the things I loved ,and it is software in my world.

##Strengths
### My habits
According to my habits when developing software, I think I like to do everything I love seriously and I always try to do a better job than required, because I am also a user of my software. For an example, I love beautiful design particularly material design recommended by Google, so I use material design in my application, and I make great efforts for a beautiful UI, an effective and a good performance. I think it is great to refactor my codes with a scientific structure. For Android, it is MVP structure. My refactored code looks more clear and elegant, although more work have to be done, it is worthwhile, and I like to do that.

### I love to try new things 
 I also like to try the new things in my programing, such as realm database, I think it is a great replace of sqlite3 on our mobile platform, one more interesting thing is Xposed framework, it can hook the methods of applications of the android . It can do many things beyond my imagination. So I give it a try to learn Xposed frameworkâ€™s module programming through Google and GitHub. I think trying new things always make me excited, and I really like it.

### I love English
I live in a world full of English, IDE is English, Offical doc is English, Github is English and so is Stackoverflow, I think it doesn't matter,and I am more and more familiar with them.
